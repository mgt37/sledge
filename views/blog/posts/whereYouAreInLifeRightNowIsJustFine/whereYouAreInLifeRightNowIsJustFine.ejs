        <p>Where you are in life right now is just fine. Whether that be finished studying and not finding the right job, or working out what to study and not being sure, or realising that what you have been studying is not right for you, or whatever the situation, it is time to relax and accept that this is all part of the journey. You have not failed. Seriously, it is a challenging path to follow, and setting your life up has got to be one of the most difficult parts. If situations have gone wrong or if you are not where you expected to be, then realise that this is completely fine. Everyone else before you has gone through this all too. If you stick in there and be prepared to tackle anything that comes at you then you will be able to look back in a few years and appreciate what it takes.</p>
        <p>If you have completed study and are finding it difficult to secure the right job then it is important to know that it takes time. Most people are not able to find their dream position straight out of study and often it is necessary to accept a role that is a step in the right direction. This does not mean that you have failed; although, this is closer to where you want to be. The skills learned from the first position are going to be useful when applying for that desired position later on, and this even includes any part time roles taken on during study.</p>
        <p>Deciding what to study can be challenging, especially if you are not sure of the best area to move into. In this situation it does not matter if you do not start studying straight away and work a fill in job for a while. It is wise to work out what to study right the first time instead of getting part way through and realising that the career options would not suit you. Take time looking at the different study options available through polytechnics and universities. Do not be afraid to ask for advice from other people, including professionals who are there to guide students in the right direction. If you are avoiding this for not wanting to look stupid, or generally afraid to ask, then stop right there. Go and talk to someone about it and assess your options. They may even appreciate you seeking advice, and the last thing they are thinking about is how stupid you are at working your life out.</p>

        <p>When changing study area after a couple of years, it may seem as if time has been wasted and that your career could have started a couple of years earlier; although, there are often other life lessons that can be taken on into the future that otherwise would not have been gained. Do not beat yourself up about it. People will not only change what they want to do during studying, but through their work life as well. It is all part of the journey, and there is no rush to get to the future.</p>
        <p>There will be situations during study and life where things go really wrong. It may seem as if your situation is the worst that it could possibly be and that it would not happen to most people. For a start, everyone has these bad life events or circumstances that cause stresses at times. If your situation has not happened before by some unlikely chance then consider that something equally bad or worse would have happened to someone else. Otherwise there are many people who have been through the same or similar experience as you. Again, it is important to say that seeking help is something that is usually available, and do not be afraid to ask. Then get on with sorting out your situation and ride it out until it improves. If this is your first bad experience, then get used to it. These happen from time to time. It is not all bad news though. There are great times around the corner as well, and they are well worth the effort and the wait.</p>
        <p>So if you are sitting there, worried and uncertain about your future, then take a moment to consider that where you are right now is just fine. It takes time to setup your life, and most people do not take a direct path to reach their desired career. Every change in direction and every step taken builds on important life skills that lead to great outcomes later on in life. Everyone goes through it, so if you are uncertain about things then go and ask those who have been there before. You are not stupid for asking, and you are not slow for taking time to sort your life out. There are mistakes to make, circumstances to endure, experiences to learn from, and many other areas of life to take on. Taking on the challenge of studying is an effort in itself, and remember that in a few years? time it will all pay off. You have the power to achieve your goals, and be sure to have fun along the way. For that is what life is all about.</p>
