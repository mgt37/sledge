        <p>If this is your final year of study, then your career is about to start. It will be great working as a graduate, and not have to think about assignments or tests any more. There are going to be free evenings and weekends, and there will be money to enjoy the newly found spare time. This all sounds great; although, there is one important step to get right before all of this can happen. The search for a job has to start, and securing a graduate position will take more of an effort than you may think. Many employers have a graduate application process that starts early in the year for the positions starting in the following year. There are also a number of search engines available for general job searches. What most students are not aware of is how useful a recruitment agent can be when looking for a graduate position. This other job search area needs to be made more widely known, as recruitment agencies open up a whole other set of potential employers that may not be available elsewhere.</p>
        
        <p>If you are searching for a graduate position then a recruitment agent provides great preparation for interviews. When you talk to a recruitment agent, they are able to focus on the areas that are important to present as a part of the application process and at an interview. They will ask for information similar to any prospective employer. It will be great practice to learn what to share and what to avoid discussing directly in an interview. It is time to work out where attention may be required in your job search strategy. Start to think about what your selling points are before the meeting. This includes your qualifications, your life achievements, and aspirations for the next few years. How about what you like to do in your spare time, or what your online profile shows about you? There will be some areas that require focus, and these will show up by discussing everything in a meeting. By talking to a recruitment agent, it will provide great preparation for those interviews ahead.</p>
        
        <p>There is usually no upfront cost in talking to a recruitment agent, and this cost is instead covered by the employers who are searching for prospective candidates. There is no financial commitment when talking to an agent, which is definitely a consideration for most students, as money is generally short. One point to keep in mind is that a position sourced through a recruitment agent may have a lower starting salary to cover the cost of sourcing you. Salary information is generally available and it would be a smart move to search starting salaries in your industry. Most employers will offer a typical starting salary, so expect to be on the lower side of this level. The benefit of having a position with a lower starting salary far outweighs not having a position at all though. If you talk to a recruitment agent then take your focus off the cost, your potential employer has got that covered.</p>

        <p>An important point to consider is that some positions will only be available through a recruitment agent. There are employers who do not have a formal application process, and instead rely mostly on a recruitment agent to source the right graduates. This means that a whole other market of jobs is only available through a different means to the standard application processes and job search engines. The only way to get access to this market is by accurately defining the position that you are after, that can include a number of different factors, such as the location, type and size of company, among other things. These employers are looking for students who can impress with not only their qualifications, and also their ability to communicate effectively, as will be tested at an interview. The recruitment agent is tasked with finding the right candidate, and you could be just the graduate they are after. Recruitment agents provide access to this other market of jobs that should not be overlooked.</p>
    
        <p>Now that you know about the benefits of talking to a recruitment agent, get ready to sell yourself and take control of your career. The search for positions may be sorted; although, it is your responsibility to drive the process, and step in to show off your skillset to prospective employers. Take a good look at what you have to offer. It is about finding a point of difference to show how you stand out from everyone else. The qualifications are only one part of the package, and they will want to get a thorough idea of who you are as a person. When you see a recruitment agent, prepare yourself exactly as for an interview, and be ready to show what defines you uniquely as an emerging graduate in your field.</p>
