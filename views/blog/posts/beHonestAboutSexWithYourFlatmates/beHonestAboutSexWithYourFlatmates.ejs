<h1>Be honest about sex with your flatmates</h1>

        <p>Sex is often not discussed for fear that talking about it could bring about a negative result, could lead to embarrassment, could lead to something other than human life. What is the reason for this, for something that is completely normal and is actually the most important thing to keep us going? If we can accept that having sex is a normal thing then that would be a great start.</p>
        <p>If you are about to move into a flat, then you are about to meet new people. Now what do these people have in common with you? Yes they are living in the same flat, they most likely share some interests with you and they will also get annoyed by certain things that you do. In that respect you have to learn how to get on with them. But wait, there is one thing that you are going to have to learn how to do. Yes that's right, how is it possible to keep your secret act hidden when all of your new flatmates are sitting in the lounge right next to your room? That is just not appropriate, and these people have only just met you, and what if they discover what is actually going on and embarrass you for it?</p>
        <p>Now this is just completely stupid and idiotic. When they have gone to bed and you are up late watching the movie, they are also secretly doing that thing that shouldn't be discussed. It is just not right to tell people about this thing called sex. I mean it causes life and everything great that goes with it. I am not going to suggest that it will be easy to discuss this with your new flatmates. It is hard to admit that you crave that feeling of pleasure that almost no one, if anyone, should miss out on.</p>

        <p>Okay now here is the point. Everyone has their way. Yes, the way of getting up the courage and admitting 'yes I do it'. What you need to do is be honest for once and just tell your flatmates that yes I just did that pleasurable thing called sex today. I also did it yesterday, and Saturday, and ... well, I suppose, every couple of days since I was 14.</p>
        <p>See that wasn't so hard was it? The thing is, if you want to get privacy then all you have to do is ask. You see, if this thing is just so good that it has to be done every day, then they are not going to be able to resist either. If you ask to have the house to yourself for a couple of hours, then they will be only happy to oblige, as they also want the same thing in return at a different time. Part of getting on in a flat is working out how to get on and how to deal with hard topics. If you are open and honest about everything then you are only going to get on much better. There is no point in lying or trying to hide it.</p>
        <p>What you need to work out together is what is acceptable within the flat. You don't have to talk directly about what you do in the other room late at night, or why you rush home after class to start studying. People appreciate your honesty and your flatmates will be the same. Hey, it may even be something that you talk really openly about, and joke about, and it could turn out to be the best time in your life.</p>
        <p>So whatever your way of doing it is. Just be honest. Your flatmates will love you for it. Oh, and don't be the one who doesn't take the hint.</p>
