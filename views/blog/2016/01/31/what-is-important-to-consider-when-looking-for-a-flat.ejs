<h1>What is important to consider when looking for a flat?</h1>

<p>When looking for a flat it is the people, the location, and the place that form part of the overall flat selection. Each of these factors has a number of things to consider. At first, it is not possible to know about everything and it often takes some experience to find out what works best and what does not work at all. Each of the main areas will be looked into below.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><u>People</u></strong></p>
<p>One of the first things to consider is the people who you will be living with. The ideal outcome is to find people who you share common interests and approach life the same way as you. In most cases, it is difficult to achieve this and a level of compromise has to be reached. In the initial viewing, it is possible to get a sense of what the others are like; although, it will take a couple of months to get used to who they really are.</p>
<p>The type of living situations that you could be in are numerous and it is important to realise the implications of each of these situations. This includes living by yourself, with classmates, with friends, with work colleagues, with family, and many other situations. You may be moving in with a best friend that you have not lived with previously and then after moving in realise that it strains your friendship. If you are living with a workmate then you may end up spending most of the day with them and find some conflict between the separation of work and personal time. These brief examples show that it is important to consider at the beginning if anything is likely to go wrong at a later stage.</p>
<p>The level of cleanliness and tidiness in the flat is an important consideration as most people have a different level of tolerance for what is defined as clean and at what frequency a flat clean is carried out. This ranges from stacks of dirty dishes in the sink with piles of laundry in the bedroom through to spotless bench tops and immaculately vacuumed carpets. If you do not share a common tolerance level then either you or your flatmate will get frustrated when you fail to notice that there are dirty mugs left on the coffee table. It is a good idea to be honest about this with your potential flatmates and also ask questions to make sure that you start off with the same expectations.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is how active everyone in the flat is. It is not absolutely essential that everyone has the same level of exercise such as getting up early to go to the gym most mornings; however, it may be important to consider the implications of living with someone who does not have the same view of exercise as you. It may surprise you that if you are the only one starting early at the gym, while everyone else is sleeping in late, then it may not work out for you. They might get frustrated from getting woken up from their sleep in, and you might get frustrated at just how lazy your flatmates are. So if this matters to you, then find people who prefer a similar level of exercise to what you do.</p>
<p>A key personality trait is the level of extroversion or introversion that someone has. This is one trait that is defined by the Myers-Briggs Test (see <a href="http://www.16personalities.com/">16 Personalities</a> if you want to find out more) and is an important consideration as it determines how you are likely to interact with your flatmates. If you are very social and prefer to be at the centre of attention, then you are likely to clash with other flatmates who want to have time to themselves away from you. It is best that you seek out someone who is also extroverted and prefers a similar level of interaction with others. It is generally possible to get an idea of this by talking with people and again being honest with what you are like.</p>
<p>It can be helpful if your flatmates have similar interests to you as there will be some common ground between what you like to do in your spare time. This is likely to indicate that there is a level of agreement in other areas as well. Not everyone has to match with your interests though and it may add an interesting dynamic to the flat. You should also not look for flatmates that want to do exactly the same thing as you, at all times, that could be very boring. A good balance between would be a suggestion to go forward with.</p>
<p>Everyone has a different schedule depending on whether they are working, studying, or engaging in something else. This could include disruption from noise, and affect the general flat dynamic. A student may sleep in until mid-morning and work until late at night, whereas a full-time worker will normally get up early, and then go to bed at an earlier time in the evening. A student schedule is variable depending on lectures and other study, whereas work is normally at a set time during the day. There may also be clashes between students studying different courses, or shift workers with those who work regular hours. If you are studying, then finding people studying similar courses, and at a similar stage, then it is most likely to suit. The same also applies for finding people working in a similar field.</p>
<p>The considerations above show how important it is to find the right people to live within a flat. There may be other factors that are important specifically to you, and it is best to consider these at the start. People can make all the difference in your flat experience.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><u>Location</u></strong></p>
<p>The location of the flat is determined by the area in which you are studying or working. There are typical suburbs that are student areas as they will be close to where the polytechnic or university is located. Other areas further away may be suitable depending on the type of travel used to get to the place of study or work.</p>
<p>The topography of the area around the flat will affect how exposed it is to the weather and the amount of sunlight it receives. This can range from a completely flat area to an open area at the top of a hill. If the flat is in an exposed location then the wind maybe more of an issue. This could include a draught caused through gaps in the external part of the house as most places are not fully airtight. If the flat is shadowed by the surrounding area then it will not receive the full amount of sunlight. In winter, some areas may be completely shaded and this can lead to damp areas with the growth of moss and mildew.</p>
<p>There may also be other considerations specific to the general location of the area. More of these factors specific to location will be added later.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><u>Place</u></strong></p>
<p>After finding the people that you would like to live with and have a general idea of the location, it is time to find a suitable flat for your group. At this stage it may seem like most things have been sorted; although, there are still important things to consider.</p>
<p>When you look for potential flats it is important to have a general idea of what you are after. There may also be hidden things that are not always considered, and that may become evident only after a few months.</p>
<p>The warmth of the house is a main consideration as it can have a direct effect on your health, especially during winter. This will also determine the amount of heating that is required during this time of year. The main things to look for are the type of glazing, and the insulation in the walls, ceiling, and floor. Check for any draughts that may indicate gaps in the outside of rooms. The type of heating within the flat will affect how warm the house can be and the expected cost. If the house is not able to be sufficiently heated then work out what other solutions are possible.</p>
<p>The size of the bedrooms determines the amount of space that each person has within the flat. If you are viewing the flat then it may be helpful to measure the size of the room. You can then check later to make sure that main items fit in the room, such as a bed, drawers, and desk. The location of the doors, windows, wardrobes and anything else may affect how these items can be placed too. Once everything is placed in the room there should ideally be space to move around and save space for airing clothes.</p>
<p>The size of the hot water cylinder should be checked to work out how much is available for the flat. At the same time check what hours of the day the water is heated. If heating is overnight then a shortage may occur later in the evening. The type of water heating will also determine how reliable the supply of hot water is. If gas water heating is used then there is unlikely to be a shortage; although, the amount of gas used will potentially be important. Anything that you can find out about hot water supply may save the unnecessary frustration of cold showers.</p>
<p>Noise is another area to think about with your flat. This could include noise from other flatmates or traffic noise. Some walls are not particularly sound proof and do not reduce the noise from another room. This can also apply to a multi-storey place where certain floors allow noise to come through easily. A good example of this would be when your flatmate is playing music loudly while you are trying to sleep. The impact of traffic noise could be significant if the flat is next to a busy road and it would be a good idea to check this from inside the house with the doors and windows closed. Do not underestimate noise as it is not always possible to remove, as is the case with traffic noise, or also noisy neighbours.</p>
<p>The expectation of the flat has to be reasonable as it will most likely be a drop from the quality of your parents? home. This does not mean that you should accept a place that is below living standards, but that your expectations need to be lowered as what to expect from your flat. The budget that you have available will determine the quality of the place that you end up in. For most students the standard of the flat will be of a similar level.</p>

<p><strong><u>Setting up the Tenancy </u></strong></p>
<p>There are a number of factors to consider when setting up the tenancy for the flat. The ?Tenancy Services? site has been set up by the Ministry of Business, Innovation &amp; Employment. This covers all of the essential areas around setting up the tenancy, including signing the contract. The link is provided as follows:</p>
