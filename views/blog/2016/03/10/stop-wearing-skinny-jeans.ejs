        <p>Stop wearing skinny jeans right now. Yes, that’s right, rip them off and get some track pants or other loose trousers on. It may be true that skinny jeans are the latest fashion trend, and that all of your friends think that they are the most attractive item out. What is also true is that these tight fitting trousers are bad for your health. Seriously, read the rest of this in your underwear if you have to. For what is shared below are the reasons why you are without pants right now.</p>
        
        <p>The first major reason is for the guys. You may not realise it, but skinny jeans are ruining your sperm count. They are restricting your crotch and not allowing sufficient airflow to this area. It may seem absolutely shocking to read something this direct; although, it is important to get straight to the point around this issue. When wearing tight trousers, parts of the body are forced to fit where they naturally should not. Skinny jeans do not provide sufficient breathability or airflow as they generally sit in tight with your crotch and leave limited space in-between. This leads to heating of this area, and guess what heat is not good for? Yes, your sperm production.</p>
       
        <p>When your crotch is restricted, your legs are also likely to be squeezed with the same issues of limited airflow and heating. Another consideration more specific to the legs is the impact on the muscles. If you wear skinny jeans then there will not be sufficient space to allow your legs to sit naturally. As a result, they force your muscles to move to wherever they can fit, and this can lead to nerve damage among other things. If you put on your skinny jeans and they force your legs to fit, then take them straight off and look for something else to wear.</p>
        
        <p>Another area where skinny jeans fail is when sweating occurs. As already mentioned, skinny jeans do not allow for normal airflow between the trousers and your legs. This means that instead of the air taking the sweat away from your legs, it ends up going straight into the trousers themselves. At a certain point sweaty trousers become uncomfortable to wear and eventually they will start to produce odour. This is why skinny jeans should never be worn while doing exercise. The same also applies to any other tight fitting clothes. If you are planning on going for a run, then make sure to put on loose items of clothing that are more appropriate for exercise.</p>

        <p>The underwear also has to fit inside of the jeans. Have you ever noticed that when you try to put your trousers on, your underwear gets pushed up or forced out of the way? That is assuming that you are wearing underwear. Seriously, put underwear on if you are not wearing anything. This should be taken as a warning sign that there is not enough space between the top area of your legs and the trousers that you are trying to put on. It also means that everything is very tight, without airflow, and likely to get sweaty. When you buy underwear it is normally desirable for room to be available for that area, so why not buy trousers that do the same thing, instead of ruining the point behind buying comfortable underwear.</p>
        
        <p>Now these are just some of the main points as to why skinny jeans are not good for your health, even if they are fashionable. I invite you to now put your pants back on, and start thinking about wearing something different to skinny jeans that is not tight fitting. It is not worth wearing trousers that reduce sperm count, restrict your legs, or lead to unwanted odour from the sweat. If people could take off their skinny jeans and appreciate how much more comfortable they feel without them, then that would be a great start. Just make sure you are wearing underwear first, we wouldn’t want anyone seeing that now would we?</p>
