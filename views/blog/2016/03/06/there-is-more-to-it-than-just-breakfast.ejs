<h1>There is more to it than just breakfast</h1>

        <p>The alarm has gone off after the third snooze and now you need to get out of bed to make it to that 8 o’clock class. This leaves just enough time to take a shower, get dressed, and do whatever else as part of your morning routine before rushing out the door. Making it to that class is now the most important goal as it is already a quarter to 8, and you have barely enough time to get there. But wait, what about breakfast? You have not even given it a second thought. Besides, you are not hungry right now, and there is a perfectly good place to buy hot chips and an energy drink later anyway. So everything is sorted, right? Well not exactly. Let us look in more detail around breakfast and why it is important to get it right. There are ways that could help you to make better decisions around breakfast, to ensure that you are best prepared for a full on day of study.</p>
        <p>If time in the morning is short, consider getting up at least 15 minutes earlier. Getting out of bed earlier may not be popular; although, allowing time for breakfast will be worthwhile for the rest of the day. The amount of sleep that you miss will be more than made up for with better energy levels during the day. Have a go at setting the alarm 15 minutes earlier and avoid hitting the snooze button. If this is too difficult on your own then you could challenge other classmates to do the same, or even meet up before class to eat breakfast with them. By getting up at least 15 minutes earlier to eat breakfast, you are setting up yourself better for the day.</p>
        <p>Before leaving in the morning, rehydrate by drinking a glass of water or two. The first thing that you do when getting out of bed is to relieve yourself; therefore, it makes sense to rehydrate at the same time. After drinking water, the same logic applies to eating breakfast to refuel after a period of fasting. Have a go at drinking water straight after getting up and then eat something a short time later. See what changes you notice for the rest of the morning. Drinking water first thing in the morning will help your body to rehydrate, and replace the water lost directly after sleep.</p>
        <p>A typical breakfast has the essential vitamins and minerals that provide for good health. This has a significant effect on concentration and performance. The difference in performance is not immediate from changing to a healthy diet; however, it has an eventual impact that makes a significant difference over time. It will be beneficial to consider eating a breakfast that is not your favourite; although, the benefit from the energy received will be worth it. Have a look in the supermarket and read the nutritional information on the labels. There are a number of cereals and breakfast foods that have too much sugar and fat in them, and these should be avoided if possible. If you can work out a healthy breakfast with the essential nutrients then it will be beneficial to your overall performance while studying.</p>
        <p>If you are not hungry right after sleep, pack something for breakfast in addition to lunch. It is possible that directly after sleep you may not feel hungry, and it is important to note that this does not mean that you will not be hungry soon after leaving home. If taking food from home then make sure that there is sufficient food for the whole day. What you could do is plan out what to eat during the day and have something for each meal or snack time. The plan does not have to be strict, it should give a rough idea of what food to take. It will also reduce the temptation to eat all of the food too early in the day. By taking enough food for breakfast and the rest of the day, your energy needs should be covered.</p>
        <p>Eating breakfast signals to your metabolism that you are going from sleep mode into an active mode. At the start of the day, your body will function in a slow mode as if still sleeping. By not eating breakfast straight away, the message that you now need to be more active and focus on study is not correctly sent to your brain. This likely leads to low energy levels at the start of the day. If the first class or two of the day is spent half asleep then you could change this by eating breakfast and notice the improvement in energy levels. Your metabolism needs to change to an active mode after sleep and eating breakfast allows for this to occur.</p>

        <p>Your mind is aware of when you are hungry, and missing breakfast will lead to a focus more on food than you may realise. This is about the subconscious level of your mind that focusses on the important decisions without being fully aware of it. You may pretend that hunger is not an issue and that everything is fine without breakfast; although, it is a natural reaction to focus on food after not eating for a period of time. There is no way to get away from your subconscious mind, you cannot be dishonest, it already knows. If you eat breakfast then your first classes of the day will become easier as your mind will then focus on learning, as opposed to why there is no food in your stomach. Missing breakfast is not a good option and it is important to realise the effect of doing so.</p>
        <p>By the middle of the morning you are going to be hungry, and lunchtime is too far away. It is necessary to eat at some point, and eating food four to six hours after waking up is not going to work out. Today, you have a number of classes back to back with only ten minutes in-between each. There is barely enough time to line up in the queue, let alone making it to your next class. Wouldn’t it be great to avoid this hassle and not have to think about food until the middle of the day? The food sold on campus will also be more expensive and some options will not be the healthiest. If you plan to eat before leaving home, or take something to class then it will make it easier. So prepare for the hunger to hit before lunchtime, as you are going to need to eat well before then.</p>
        <p>Food options that are less healthy will be tempting in order to make up for skipping breakfast. The food available at the places on campus will have a range of options available; although, your craving for energy is higher now, and the less healthy food is going to be more attractive. The hot chips are going to be great to provide a carbohydrate boost and an energy drink will give an instant increase in energy with a sugar hit. What is so bad about eating these anyway? The problem is that these options do not provide a stable energy level for the rest of the day and do not provide a great balance of essential vitamins and minerals. The potato in the hot chips would be fine by itself; although, it has been cooked in fatty oils which are not that healthy. The energy drinks are filled with a large amount of sugar, which is usually much more than a recommended serving. There is little nutritional benefit in these drinks, and they may even contain stimulants that effect the natural balance of energy in your system. These less healthy food options will be hard to resist when skipping breakfast, and it is important to realise the effect that these will have on your energy levels and general health.</p>
        <p>The energy needs of a student are high and at the same time the food budget available is low. If you are struggling to find enough money for even the most basic food then it is important to reach out for help. As a student, you should not be expected to go hungry. It is just not possible to perform at your best when your attention is diverted by that empty stomach. Options for reaching out for help include asking family for money, or talking to student services, among other things. It is better that you let someone know of your situation and then something can be done about it. Make sure that if money is short, that you do not go hungry.</p>
        <p>Now that we have looked at all of the important areas around breakfast, you should now be able to work out what is best for you. We are not suggesting that everyone should get up at the exact same time to eat breakfast, or that delaying breakfast for a couple of hours is a bad idea. It is more about making smarter choices and understanding the potential impacts on performance while studying. See for yourself how great it is when the morning slump is no longer there and you can make it through to lunch time without a second thought. So remember that there is more to it than just breakfast.</p>
