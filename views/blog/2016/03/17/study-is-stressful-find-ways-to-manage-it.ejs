        <p>When study starts to get busy, the pressure comes on, and stress becomes apparent. Those deadlines for the assignments are coming up fast, money is getting tight, and there is the matter of cooking for your flatmates tonight. How is it possible to manage all of this? Stress has come down hard as a reminder of all the tasks that have to be balanced as a part of studying. What you need to do is find ways to get away from the stress, at least for a short while. Take the focus away from your study, all of the other demands, and zone out from whatever you may be doing. Get out your headphones, play some relaxing music, close your eyes, and then just relax. Be sure not to do this in class though, or your lecturer will find a way to embarrass you for not paying attention. There are plenty of good other places though. Find your favourite place and be ready to tune out.</p>
        
        <p>A set of headphones provides a great way to zone out from your surroundings. If you do not own a set then make sure that you find a way to get some before money gets tight. Oh, and find some music that can relax you. This does not have to be classical music by the way. It could be a range of music; although, we suggest something on the easy listening side. This ensures that the whole purpose of relaxing is achieved, and you can listen to the other music later in the week at a party anyway. There are a range of options out there to suit any music taste. Have a look in the online music store and find your sound. Then put on your music player, your set of headphones, and enjoy zoning out from the world.</p>
        
        <p>A 15 minute power nap is a great way to relax for a short period. It is about closing your eyes, taking time out, and recharging for the rest of the day. There is no need to be embarrassed about closing your eyes for a short period of time. We are not suggesting that you nap in your classes, or sit in the middle of a busy area and rest; although, there will be some appropriate places to nap. The area does not have to be completely silent either. Have a look around and find somewhere that suits you. It could be on a couch in the library, a shaded area under trees, behind a partition in a computer lab, or anywhere really. So go find a comfortable spot, set a timer for 15 minutes, and nap.</p>
        
        <p>Exercise is a great way to take a break in-between study. After sitting at a computer for a few hours, there are a number of reasons to leave this space for a while, other than the usual reasons to get out of your seat. Your focus will eventually lapse from study, there could be boredom, and there is the stale air, among a range of other things. By taking a break out of study, there is an opportunity to recharge, to breathe in the fresh air, and see what is happening around your area. You could walk, run, cycle, go the gym, or participate in a range of other exercises. It is up to you what type of exercise to choose. Find something that gets you going, that could be relaxing, or challenging. So break up your study session and go for some exercise.</p>
        
        <p>Taking a shower or running your hands and face under water can be a great way to rejuvenate yourself. A shower will refresh your body by removing any sweat and providing general relaxation. If your hands and face are hot then cold water will help to refresh them, or else hot water can warm up cold hands and face. See if there is anywhere that you can take a shower in the middle of the day away from home. All you need is a towel and soap, and then you are sorted. A fresh pair of underwear or socks usually helps too. You can be relaxed about taking the shower too, as you do not need to cover the cost of the hot water. So the next time that you are stressed, see if you can take a shower, or else running your hands and face under water will do the trick.</p>

        <p>In addition to any time allocated for study, exercise, or daily tasks, save some time to relax. It may seem as though there is absolutely no time left in the day, or that not studying all day will lead to falling behind. In fact, taking time out will ensure that you are not burning yourself out and are able to stay sane in those particularly stressful periods. This is time that you are allowed to have, and is a regular time that is available to un-focus from that large assignment or important final exam coming up. The length of time could be at least an hour for most days of the week, or whatever suits your busy schedule. If you are short on time then consider combining your time off, with exercise, for example; although, there should be time outside of exercise at least to do something fun. Remember that taking time out from your regular routine is important to give yourself time to relax from study.</p>
       
        <p>A massage to particular areas of your body, or stretches are great ways to destress. Either of these options should not be underestimated as they are great ways to relieve tension that will build up from stress. It is about targeting the pressure points that provide the power to unlock the tension build up. We are not experts at massage therapy and suggest that you see http://hackmystudy.com/how-to-deal-with-study-stress-and-anxiety/ for their massage and stretch options, as a start. The idea is to be able to do these exercises by yourself so that there is no need to rely on a flatmate or classmate to give you a back rub when stressed; although, there may be some people out there who would be willing to. A shoulder massage would be really great if you manage to find someone. For most people though, a stretch or massage routine will be solo. Find out what exercises work for you and then appreciate the great relief of destressing.</p>
        
        <p>There are various ways to tackle stress and we challenge you to find your own ideas for how to manage it. Do not stress about it though. Sometimes the balance will be out, and it seems that everything is overwhelming. This is what you perceive, and there are ways to control and change this perception. All you need to do is plan a time to zone out, to take a break from absolutely everything in your life. That spot over there is waiting for you, go over there and relax, and take a load off your mind. Once the stress is managed, your focus will return for whatever the rest of the day demands from you.</p>
