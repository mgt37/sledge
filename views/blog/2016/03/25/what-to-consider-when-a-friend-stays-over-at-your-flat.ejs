        <p>After waking up you normally head straight to the shower. There is no need to put anything else on apart from your underwear, when walking to the bathroom. Your flatmates are fine with it, and why would this be any different this morning? The clothes that you are wearing today are on the hanger in the living room, and rushing through to grab them will be no issue. The curtains will be closed, and no-one will be able to see you out the window. None of your flatmates are awake yet either. So what could go wrong? As you walk into the living room, the situation becomes instantly awkward. There is someone on the couch and they have just woken up to see you in nothing apart from your underwear. Who is this person and what are they doing in this flat? There was no warning from any of your flatmates about having their partner over to stay, and now there is going to be an awkward conversation to follow. Where did this all go wrong and what can be done to improve the situation around guests staying at your flat? Living with flatmates can be interesting at times, even more so when they have their friends over to stay. It is usually best to know well in advance; although, some flatmates will give little or no notice. There are also a number of other rules to consider to avoid conflict within your flat.</p>
        <p>The bathroom is an area that is often in high demand in the morning and guests need to respect this. In the morning most people have a set amount of time to get ready, and part of that time is spent in the bathroom. When there is a single bathroom shared between multiple people then the consideration around use is much more important. If your guest has decided to start taking a long shower at the time when your flatmate is just waking up then it is likely to cause conflict. They will have been asleep all night, most likely needing to use the bathroom and waiting is not going to be an option that suits them. There is also the delay to having a shower themselves and getting ready before rushing out the door. The discussion around bathroom time should be made clear so that any guests fit around the flatmates’ usual routines, and avoid any awkward situations that may arise. If you are going to have a guest over then they need to consider when your flatmates are using the bathroom.</p>
        <p>The living room is the main common area and use of this space by guests will impact on your flatmates. If your guest is sleeping over, and there is not room in your bedroom, then it is likely that the couch in the living room is the only available option. The question is, will the other flatmates mind? If they get up in the morning to find someone asleep on the couch, then they will now be obliged to keep quiet for someone that does not even normally live there. Some flatmates may decide that respecting your friend’s sleep is too much, open the curtains, make loud noise, and do whatever else. One person watching television and another sleeping does not go together in one space. So the next time that you want a friend to sleep over, consider the impact on your flatmates and the inconvenience it may pose on them.</p>
        <p>The bedroom is one place in the flat that is your own space. This is where you can enjoy your own quality time doing whatever pleases you, whether that be having a fun time with your partner, or playing games on your own console. This space is not separate from the rest of the flat, and what goes on in there can impact the rest of your flatmates, especially if there is excessive noise from that online game you love to play into the night. The general hours when quiet is appreciated is between 11pm and 7am; although, in your flat, there may be different hours that are desirable for low noise. This could include the weekends when your flatmates would give you negative feedback when playing loud music before 10am. It may be true that the bedroom is your own space, and remember that it is still part of the overall flat.</p>

        <p>The food that your friend eats at the flat should either be their own, or your food in the flat. It is generally not acceptable for them to open the fridge and choose whatever they would like to eat. Most of the food would have been bought by your flatmates, and would be considered off-limits, unless they have given your friend permission. Any shared food that you and your friend have eaten should be replaced as part of your next shop. Each flat has a different system for buying food and how this is kept in the fridge or pantry. If your friend knows that a particular shelf is yours and that a certain area of the fridge is for shared items, then they are less likely to eat other’s food by mistake. If you make sure that your friend stays away from the other flatmate’s food, then it removes this as a conflict point in the flat.</p>
        <p>If you have a friend regularly staying over at your flat then they should be paying for some of the rent and bills. Everyone else living at the flat has to pay for being there and an additional person staying for free does not fit right with everyone else. If this is a one-off night staying over then the additional costs are likely to be minor. When they are staying at the flat more frequently, the rent could be split evenly between all of the flatmates and them for each night they are there. The same would apply to the bills. The previous bills can be used to estimate how much they should be pitching in to make it fair. Another example is the boyfriend rule. This rule states that if your partner is staying over in your flat, then it should be matched by a night staying over at your partner’s flat. It limits your flatmate’s partner to a maximum of three nights staying over a week.  The boyfriend rule provides a fair balance that allows the rest of the flatmates at least three nights off from your partner, and also a balance to the rent and bills. Once the money side of things is sorted then it is less likely to be a conflict point in the rest of the flat. So be sure to consider what share of the rent and bills your friend should be paying when they stay over.</p>
    
        <p>You should now be prepared for the next time when inviting a friend over to your flat. There are a number of other suggestions to make it easier for guests staying over:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>If you are going to be using the living room for the evening, then consider inviting your flatmate to join in. They may not be comfortable to be in the room with you unless specifically ask.</li>
        <li>For most flats a one-off night for someone staying over would be considered acceptable. If the length of time is for more than an evening then it is likely to be unacceptable, unless everyone agrees first.</li>
        <li>If the main living areas are close to the bedroom, then consider the impact of any noise on the rest of your flatmates that may be sleeping. In general it is respectful for noise to be kept to a minimum between 11pm and 7am. Different hours may apply during weekends.</li>
        <li>If you are having a friend over then it may be considered inappropriate for them to be left alone in the flat, while you are out somewhere. Rules around guests staying in the flat should be consistent for ever flatmate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A key point before your friend arrives at the flat, is to make sure that your flatmates know and agree to them staying over. As soon as you know that guests may be staying over, it is best to ask your flatmates whether it is suitable for them. They may decline your guest staying over and that is something that you may have to accept occasionally. Remember that they are more likely to be okay with it when this is discussed up front, with adequate warning. Your flatmates would ideally do the same for you, and coming to an agreement for what works in the flat might be a great way to deal with guests staying over. So when you plan to have guests over, just make sure that other flatmates know about it.</p>
