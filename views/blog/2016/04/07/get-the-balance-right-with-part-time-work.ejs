        <p>Every student faces the challenge of balancing money. If you need more money, then taking on part time work may seem like a great option. There will be more money available to spend on other things apart from just the basics, and the trade-off is less time available for study and social activities. This seems to be a simple balance between money and time; although, there is another aspect that has not been considered in this picture. How about the impact to your ability to study, and the time left over to enjoy the social side of being a student? There is definitely going to be an impact on everything else, and it is more than just losing time. What this effectively means is that the quality of your student experience will be affected. Life may not be as fun, especially if your performance drops, there is no time available to party, and there are other demands to juggle with living away from home. Part time work will always be desirable for the money that it can provide; and you should ask yourself if this is really worth pursuing before committing to it.</p>
        
        <p>An important consideration is how part time work will impact on your health. There will be a limited amount of spare time available while studying, and taking on part time work only reduces this further. It is about making sure that you have enough time left over for sleep, exercise and general time out to relax. The stress from study itself can be high at specific times of the semester when tests are close and assignment deadlines are looming. From part time work there will be additional demands, and this will only increase the workload that needs to be managed. At some point the amount of stress becomes too high and there will be a shortage of time to fit in everything. One area that is most likely to be impacted is sleep. If there is not enough time, then you will not wake up properly recharged. When you are stressed it can be difficult to get off to sleep. The follow on effect is the impact to your health which in turn can have a direct impact on studying. If you take on part time work then it may put the pressure onto everything else, especially if your study schedule is already full on.</p>
        
        <p>The part time work available may be unskilled work and not add any benefit to your CV. This effectively means that the work may provide only money, and not any other obvious benefits for your future career. It is necessary to highlight that this type of work is different to summer internships and placements that will definitely add to your skillset when applying later for graduate positions. Consider that the money that is earned in unskilled work is generally at or just above minimum wage level, and is much lower than what will be earned after graduating. The unskilled work is a short term fix to find extra money, and could impact on the long term focus of securing a graduate position. The additional pressure could impact on your ability to study effectively, reduce your grades, and make you appear as a less attractive candidate when it comes to applying for graduate positions later on. Be careful when taking on unskilled work and consider what benefits are actually provided to you other than the financial side.</p>

        <p>The social time available is important both during study and after study. The social activities available while studying provide a great break away from the stress and time to interact with classmates and newly found friends. During these times, relationships are built up with classmates and these can last well into the future. It is important to develop networks with fellow students as they can be useful after study. This includes having other people to talk with about professional development, or even other people to socialise with. The trouble with part time work is that it can take away the time available for social activities. It could be that your work is on a weekend night, when parties are normally held, or there is simply not enough time remaining as you have to finish that assignment due in a couple of days. Part time work could be taking away more than just your short term fun at social events. Building relationships with classmates and making friends while studying is important for both during study and the long term.</p>
        
        <p>Talking to a financial advisor is a great way to receive guidance about managing money. Most places of study have student services that are able to provide financial assistance when money becomes tight or difficult to manage. Before taking on part time work it would be wise to talk with a financial advisor to find out if there is a way to manage your budget within the money already available. You can work out what your sources of income are and the regular expenses that need to be paid. Once the difference is known, then you can determine what your overall financial situation is. A financial advisor will be able to take you through the rest of the assessment. There may be extra options for financial support, and if you can show your typical budget clearly, it may be easier to apply for extra support. So take advantage of talking to a financial advisor for help with managing your money.</p>
        
        <p>The balance around part time work needs to be carefully considered. Money is an obvious benefit; although, there are negative impacts to consider. Your health could be impacted as part time work may add additional stress to the already high demands of study. The amount of time for social activities may be reduced and this could impact on your long term relationship building with classmates and friends. It is normal for there to be limited time available while studying, and do you really want to give that time up to work? Your experience as a student should provide enough time for enjoyment in addition to all of the other demands of study. This is a great time of your life to make the most of and you should be at all of those parties. That unskilled job is taking away more than just time, so consider carefully whether you really need to work part time while studying.</p>
